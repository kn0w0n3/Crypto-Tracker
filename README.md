## About

This application was built with Qt creator 4.12.3 and Qt framework 5.14.2  

The CoinCap API is being used to retrieve crypto data.   

If you plan to build from source, you will need to use your own API key. The application will still wotk, however when an API key is not being used, API calls are limited to 200 per minute. Other people will be testing without an API key and data will not be pulled consistently. About every other API call will fail. Binaries will be provided soon that include an API to provide consistent data flow.
