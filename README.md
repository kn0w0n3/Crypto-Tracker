## About

This application was built with Qt creator 4.12.3 and Qt framework 5.15.0  

The CoinCap API is being used to retrieve crypto data.   

If you plan to build from source, you will need to use your own Coin Cap API key for the application to function properly. Your API key can be added in the cryptoinfo.cpp file.  

The K-Lite Codec Pack will need to be installed if the video background is not working: https://codecguide.com/download_kl.htm
